upon further practice with the Git Bash terminal/interface decided was best 
to archive off teh original master branch (now called master_old) and 
replace with a new master branch that simply contains the website files

Website content has not changed since version that was submitted 
(except for perhaps the wording in one of the annoucments as I was testing pushing from Git)
