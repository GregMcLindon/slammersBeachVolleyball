Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 12 months (except for including the new web site), so that any change in diversity should be attributable to the site. At the end of this 12 month period (and during), the survey will be repeated and the diversity results will be compared to the previous 12 months. A target has been set of an increace in player base of 50% (150 players per week) with the majority percentage increase to be in the 15-30 year old age category.

Target Audience

Local residents, mostly between the ages of 15 to 35 which is the age category expecting to see the most increase in player base and this is who the site is aimed at (the home page). A section of the site will be created for existing members in the 35-50 year old category but this is a secondary function of the site.
